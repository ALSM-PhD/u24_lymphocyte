This is a quick implementation of codes to generate cluster maps of TIL-positive 
patches after cluster index computations. The codes expect the input and output 
files of the cluster index computation step and image metadata as input and 
output cluster groupings of TIL-positive patches as CSV and JSON files that can be 
loaded to QuIP by featuredb-loader.
