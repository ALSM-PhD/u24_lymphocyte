## Prerequisites

To start these steps there are several prerequisites.  These instructions assume you have installed the base files under the folder "u24_lymphocyte" and all paths given here will be under that.  You must first run the TIL prediction phase and have prediction files in the data/heatmap_txt folder.  The associated images matching the prediction data you have need to be in "data/svs".
